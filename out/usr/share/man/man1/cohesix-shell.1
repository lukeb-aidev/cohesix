.SH NAME
cohesix-shell \- invokes a BusyBox-compatible interactive shell within the Cohesix environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cohesix-shell
.RI [ ARGS ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcohesix-shell\fR is the canonical wrapper for launching the Cohesix BusyBox runtime.
It executes the BusyBox binary shipped in Cohesix with the \fBsh\fR applet and
forwards any user-provided arguments to that shell. The command exits with the
same status returned by BusyBox, allowing scripts to check success or failure.
.PP
If the BusyBox process terminates because of a signal or cannot be spawned,
\fBcohesix-shell\fR prints an error message to standard error and exits with a
non-zero status.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B COHESIX_BUSYBOX_PATH
Overrides the default BusyBox path of \fI/mnt/data/bin/cohbox\fR. This is
useful in development or testing environments where BusyBox is staged in a
temporary directory.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /mnt/data/bin/cohbox
Default BusyBox binary executed by \fBcohesix-shell\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
BusyBox executed successfully and returned success.
