# Root Task Crate

The `root-task` crate embodies the responsibilities described in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1-§3:

- Own the initial capabilities and boot flow transferred from seL4.
- Configure timers and the scheduling surface that powers worker budget enforcement.
- Bootstrap the NineDoor 9P server and provision worker tickets for the queen orchestration loop.
- Orchestrate serial, timer, networking, and IPC work through a
  cooperative event pump that replaces the legacy busy loop.

## Event Pump Overview

`src/event/mod.rs` introduces `EventPump`, a no-`std` coordinator that
rotates through serial IO (`serial::SerialPort`), timer ticks,
feature-gated networking polls, and IPC dispatch. Each cycle emits
structured audit lines (`event-pump: init …`, `attach accepted`,
`attach denied`) so operators can correlate subsystem activity with the
serial log. Authentication is backed by a deterministic
`TicketTable`, ensuring that bootstrap tickets are validated without
heap allocation.

## Serial Console

`src/serial/mod.rs` provides a heapless serial façade. Input is
sanitised to UTF-8, backspaces are honoured, and atomic counters expose
RX/TX saturation metrics for `/proc/boot`. The console parser enforces
maximum line length, exponential back-off for repeated authentication
failures, and capability checks before invoking orchestration verbs.

## Testing & Feature Flags

The crate ships unit and integration tests that exercise the event pump
and console authentication flows:

```
cargo test -p root-task event_pump
```

Networking glue lives behind the `net` feature flag so developers can
iterate on console-only changes without pulling in smoltcp. Enable the
feature when validating the bounded virtio queues or smoltcp polls:

```
cargo check -p root-task --features net
cargo clippy -p root-task --features net --tests
```

Host-mode simulations continue to live in `src/host.rs`; they can be
expanded to exercise the event pump by wiring deterministic timers or
mock serial transports as the milestone progresses.
