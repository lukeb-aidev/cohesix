# Cohesix Interfaces (Queen/Worker, NineDoor, GPU Bridge)

## 1. NineDoor 9P Operations
- Supports **9P2000.L** only (`version`, `attach`, `walk`, `open`, `read`, `write`, `clunk`, `stat`, `remove` (disabled)).
- `msize` negotiated ≤ 8192 bytes; larger requests rejected with `Rerror(TooBig)`.
- Fid tables are per-session; `clunk` invalidates handles immediately.
- Path components limited to 255 bytes and must be valid UTF-8 without NULs.

## 2. Capability Ticket
```rust
pub struct Ticket(pub [u8; 32]);

pub struct TicketClaims {
    pub role: Role,
    pub budget: Budget,
    pub mounts: MountSpec,
    pub issued_at_ms: u64,
}
```
- Minted by root task, delivered out-of-band during `attach`.
- Encoded using BLAKE3 MAC over claims to prevent tampering.

## 3. Queen Control Surface
Path: `/queen/ctl` (append-only JSON lines)
```json
{"spawn":"heartbeat","ticks":100,"budget":{"ttl_s":120,"ops":500}}
{"kill":"worker-7"}
{"bind":{"from":"/worker","to":"/shadow"}}
{"mount":{"service":"gpu-bridge","at":"/gpu"}}
{"spawn":"gpu","lease":{"gpu_id":"GPU-0","mem_mb":4096,"streams":2,"ttl_s":120}}
```
- Lines must parse as UTF-8 JSON; unknown fields logged and ignored.
- `spawn:"gpu"` queues a lease request for the host GPU bridge; if the bridge is unavailable the command returns `Error::Busy`.

## 4. Worker Telemetry
- Path: `/worker/<id>/telemetry` (append-only, newline-delimited records).
- Heartbeat payload: `{"tick":42,"ts_ms":123456789}`.
- GPU payload (future): `{"job":"jid-9","state":"RUNNING","progress":0.42}`.

## 5. GPU Bridge Files (host-mirrored, future)
| Path | Mode | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `/gpu/<id>/info` | read-only | JSON metadata: vendor, model, memory, SMs, driver/runtime versions |
| `/gpu/<id>/ctl` | append-only | Lease management: `LEASE`, `RELEASE`, `PRIORITY <n>` |
| `/gpu/<id>/job` | append-only | JSON job descriptors (validated hash, grid/block dims) |
| `/gpu/<id>/status` | read-only append stream | Job lifecycle entries (QUEUED/RUNNING/OK/ERR) |

## 6. Root Task RPC (internal trait)
```rust
pub trait RootTaskControl {
    fn spawn(&self, role: Role, spec: WorkerSpec) -> Result<WorkerId, SpawnError>;
    fn kill(&self, id: WorkerId) -> Result<(), KillError>;
    fn bind(&self, session: SessionId, from: &str, to: &str) -> Result<(), NamespaceError>;
    fn mount(&self, session: SessionId, service: &str, at: &str) -> Result<(), NamespaceError>;
}
```
- NineDoor invokes these methods after validating JSON commands and ticket permissions.
- `WorkerSpec` includes budget, initial telemetry seed, and optional GPU lease request.

## 7. CLI (`cohsh`) Protocol
- Client attaches using the queen or worker ticket, negotiates `msize`, then issues 9P ops corresponding to shell commands.
- `tail` uses repeated `read` calls with offset tracking; NineDoor enforces append-only by ignoring provided offsets.
- `bind` and `mount` commands are no-ops for non-queen roles.

## 8. Error Surface
| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Permission` | Role not permitted to access path or mode |
| `NotFound` | Path or worker ID missing |
| `Busy` | Resource in use (GPU lease, worker slot) |
| `Invalid` | JSON parse failure or malformed 9P frame |
| `TooBig` | Frame exceeds negotiated `msize` |
| `Closed` | Fid used after `clunk` or revoked ticket |

## 9. Documentation Hooks
- Any new command or file path must be documented here and referenced from `ROLES_AND_SCHEDULING.md` and `BUILD_PLAN.md` before implementation.
