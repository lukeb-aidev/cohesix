# Example Documents Directory

This folder contains sample markdown files that illustrate the required headers and overall style for community-facing documentation. Use these examples as a starting point when drafting new docs or guides.

Review the headers in each example file and replicate them when creating new documentation so entries remain consistent with `METADATA.md`.
