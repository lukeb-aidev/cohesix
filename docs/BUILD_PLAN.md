# Cohesix Build Plan (ARM64, Pure Rust Userspace)

**Host:** macOS 26 on Apple Silicon (M4)
**Target:** QEMU aarch64 `virt` (GICv3)
**Kernel:** Upstream seL4 (external build)
**Userspace:** Pure Rust crates (`root-task`, `nine-door`, `worker-heart`, future `worker-gpu`, `gpu-bridge` host tool)

The milestones below build cumulatively; do not advance until the specified checks pass and documentation is updated. Each step
is grounded in the architectural intent outlined in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the repository conventions from `docs/REPO_LAYOUT.md`,
and the interface contracts codified in `docs/INTERFACES.md`. Treat those documents as non-negotiable source material when
preparing and executing tasks.

## Milestone 0 — Repository Skeleton & Toolchain (1–2 days)
**Deliverables**
- Cargo workspace initialised with crates for `root-task`, `nine-door`, and `worker-heart` plus shared utility crates.
- `toolchain/setup_macos_arm64.sh` script checking for Homebrew dependencies, rustup, and QEMU - and installing if absent.
- `scripts/qemu-run.sh` that boots seL4 with externally built `elfloader`, `kernel.elf`, also creates and uses `rootfs.cpio`.
- `ci/size_guard.sh` enforcing < 4 MiB CPIO payload.
- Repository tree matches `docs/REPO_LAYOUT.md`, and architecture notes from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §1-§3` are captured in crate
  READMEs or module docs to prevent drift.

**Checks**
- `cargo check` succeeds for the workspace.
- `qemu-system-aarch64 --version` reports the expected binary.
- `ci/size_guard.sh out/rootfs.cpio` rejects oversized archives.

## Milestone 1 — Boot Banner, Timer, & First IPC
**Deliverables**
- Root task prints a banner and configures a periodic timer tick.
- Root task spawns a secondary user component via seL4 endpoints.
- Demonstrate one ping/pong IPC exchange and timer-driven logging.
- Scaffold `cohsh` CLI prototype (command parsing + mocked transport) per `docs/USERLAND_AND_CLI.md §2-§4` so operators can
  observe logs via `tail` and exercise attach/login flows defined in `docs/INTERFACES.md §7`.

**Checks**
- QEMU serial shows boot banner and periodic `tick` line.
- QEMU serial logs `PING 1` / `PONG 1` sequence exactly once per boot.
- No panics; QEMU terminates cleanly via monitor command.

## Milestone 2 — NineDoor Minimal 9P
**Deliverables**
- Secure9P codec + fid/session table implementing `version`, `attach`, `walk`, `open`, `read`, `write`, `clunk`.
- Synthetic namespace publishing:
  - `/proc/boot` (read-only text)
  - `/log/queen.log` (append-only)
  - `/queen/ctl` (append-only command sink)
  - `/worker/<id>/telemetry` (append-only, created on spawn)
- In-VM transport (shared ring or seL4 endpoint wrapper). No TCP inside the VM.
- `cohsh` CLI upgraded to speak the live NineDoor transport (mock removed) while preserving operator workflows.
- Implementation satisfies the defences and layering requirements from `docs/SECURE9P.md §2-§5` and strictly adheres to
  `docs/INTERFACES.md §1-§6` for operation coverage, ticket validation, and error semantics.

**Checks**
- Integration test attaches, walks, reads `/proc/boot`, and appends to `/queen/ctl`.
- Attempting to write to `/proc/boot` fails with `Permission`.
- Decoder corpus covers malformed frames (length mismatch, fid reuse).

## Milestone 3 — Queen/Worker MVP with Roles
**Deliverables**
- Role-aware access policy implementing `Queen` and `WorkerHeartbeat` roles.
- `/queen/ctl` accepts JSON commands:
  - `{"spawn":"heartbeat","ticks":100}`
  - `{"kill":"<id>"}`
  - `{"budget":{"ttl_s":120,"ops":1000}}` (optional fields)
- Worker-heart process appends `"heartbeat <tick>"` lines to `/worker/<id>/telemetry`.
- Budget enforcement (ttl/ticks/ops) with automatic revocation.
- Access policy follows `docs/ROLES_AND_SCHEDULING.md §1-§5` and the queen control schema in `docs/INTERFACES.md §3-§4`; all
  JSON handling must reject unknown formats as defined in the error table (`docs/INTERFACES.md §8`).

**Checks**
- Writing spawn command creates worker directory and live telemetry stream.
- Writing kill removes worker directory and closes telemetry file.
- Role isolation tests deny cross-role reads/writes.

## Milestone 4 — Bind & Mount Namespaces
**Deliverables**
- Per-session mount table with `bind(from, to)` and `mount(service, at)` operations scoped to a single path.
- Queen-only commands for namespace manipulation exposed via `/queen/ctl`.
- Namespace operations mirror the behaviour defined in `docs/INTERFACES.md §3` and respect mount expectations in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4`.

**Checks**
- Queen remaps `/queen` to a subdirectory without affecting other sessions.
- Attempted bind by a worker fails with `Permission`.

## Milestone 5 — Hardening & Test Automation (ongoing)
**Deliverables**
- Unit tests for codec, fid lifecycle, and access policy negative paths.
- Fuzz harness covering length-prefix mutations and random tail bytes for the decoder.
- Integration test: spawn heartbeat → emit telemetry → kill → verify revocation logs.
- Cohsh regression scripts (per `docs/USERLAND_AND_CLI.md §6-§7`) execute against mock and QEMU targets, ensuring CLI and
  Secure9P behaviours stay aligned.

**Checks**
- `cargo test` passes in CI.
- Fuzz harness runs N iterations (configurable) without panic.

## Milestone 6 — GPU Worker Integration
**Deliverables**
- Define `WorkerGpu` role and extend `/queen/ctl` schema with GPU lease requests.
- Host-side `gpu-bridge-host` tool implementing NVML-based discovery (feature-gated) and `--mock` namespace mirroring for `/gpu/<id>/*`.
- Job submission protocol (JSON) supporting vector add and matrix multiply kernels with SHA-256 payload validation, optional inline payloads, and status fan-out to `/gpu/<id>/status` and `/worker/<id>/telemetry`.
- Implementation must align with `docs/GPU_NODES.md §2-§7`, uphold the command schemas in `docs/INTERFACES.md §3-§5`, and keep
  VM-side responsibilities within the boundaries in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7-§8`.
- All temporary scaffolds, mocks, or stubs have been replaced with production-grade integrations; the completed build plan
  represents the fully implemented Cohesix stack.

**Checks**
- Queen spawns a GPU worker (simulated if real hardware unavailable) and receives telemetry lines.
- Lease expiry revokes worker access and closes `/gpu/<id>/job` handle.
- Host integration tests run in `--mock` mode when GPUs are absent.

> **Rule of Engagement:** Advance milestones sequentially, treat documentation as canonical, and keep code/tests aligned after every milestone increment.

## Milestone 7 — Standalone Console & Networking
**Deliverables**
- Integrate a minimal `no_std` TCP/IP stack (e.g., smoltcp) inside the root task so UEFI deployments can expose a loopback and single host-facing interface without pulling in a full POSIX layer.
- Provide a serial-first command shell bundled with the root task that mirrors the `cohsh` command surface (attach/tail/log/help/quit) and forwards privileged operations into the existing NineDoor capability model.
- Supply a network-backed transport that accepts authenticated `cohsh` sessions over TCP while preserving capability ticket validation.
- Harden the new surface: rate-limit inbound connections, validate line-oriented commands, and document secure defaults in `docs/INTERFACES.md`.
- Update architecture docs to explain the on-device console, serial/TCP flows, and minimal TCB impact.

**Checks**
- UEFI boot image brings up the root task, configures the network interface, and accepts shell input over serial and TCP.
- `cohsh` can attach remotely via the new transport while the embedded shell remains available for direct console access.
- Integration tests cover invalid/slow-path networking scenarios; fuzz tests protect the command parser.
