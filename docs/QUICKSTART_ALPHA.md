# Alpha Quickstart (Status)

The current alpha workflow is the QEMU-based bring-up documented in
`docs/QUICKSTART.md` and `docs/USERLAND_AND_CLI.md`.

## Not yet available
The following alpha deliverables are **planned** but not implemented yet:
- `coh doctor`
- the `cohesix` Python client and examples
- UEFI hardware bring-up
- AWS AMI pipeline

These items will be introduced in Milestones 24–27 per `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` and
only then will this document expand into a full alpha quickstart guide.
