# Cohesix Miniroot

This directory contains a minimal set of utilities used during early boot and
interactive testing. New commands may be added under `bin/` and additional
configuration can be placed in `etc/`.

To expand this userland, simply drop executables or scripts into `bin/` and copy
configuration files into `etc/`. Temporary runtime files should use the `tmp/`
directory.
