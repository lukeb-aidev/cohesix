# AGENTS — Cohesix Build Charter (Pure Rust Userspace, ARM64)
You are a world-class Operating System designer with deep expertise in seL4 and Rust on aarch64. You are building Cohesix, a new operating system providing a control plane for highly secure management of edge GPU nodes, using a Queen/Worker paradigm for one-to-many orchestration and telemetry.

## Scope & Targets
- **Host**: macOS 26 on Apple Silicon (M4).
- **Target VM**: QEMU `aarch64/virt` with GICv3.
- **Target Hardware**: UEFI `aarch64/virt` , details TBC.
- **Kernel**: Upstream seL4 (external; never vendored).
- **Userspace**: Pure Rust root task, NineDoor 9P server, worker suites, and host-side client and GPU bridge tools.

## Kernel Build Artefacts
- Reference kernel build outputs (headers, slot layouts, generated metadata) reside in `seL4/build/`.

## Operating Rules
1. **Single Source of Truth** — This `AGENTS.md`, plus `README.md` and `/docs/*.md` constitute canonical guidance. Update them alongside code.
1a. **Compiler Alignment** — All manifests and generated artefacts (`root_task.toml`, `coh-rtc` outputs) define the system state. Code or docs that diverge from compiler output are invalid; regenerate manifests instead of editing generated code.
2. **No Scope Creep** — Implement only items sanctioned by the active milestone in `BUILD_PLAN.md`.
3. **Atomic Work** — Each task must land with compiling code (`cargo check`) and updated tests/docs. Keep commits focused.
4. **Tiny TCB** — No POSIX emulation layers. GPU integration stays outside the VM. The code footprint must be self-contained and secure.
5. **Capability Discipline** — Interactions occur through 9P namespaces using role-scoped capability tickets.
6. **Keep it Simple and Elegant** — Do not over engineer. Follow Rust best practice. Follow seL4 on aarch64 best practice. Always consider compatibility with docs/BUILD_PLAN.md.
7. **Tooling Alignment** — Use the macOS ARM64 toolchain in `TOOLCHAIN_MAC_ARM64.md`. Do not assume Linux-specific tooling in VM code.

### Worker Bring-up
- Root-task spawns **queen**, **worker-heart**, and **worker-gpu** per the sequencing in `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`, handing out scheduling contexts that follow `docs/ROLES_AND_SCHEDULING.md` budgets.
- Workers run solely via their mounted namespaces (e.g., `/worker/<id>`), exchanging tickets and telemetry through Secure9P; no host-initiated ad-hoc RPC exists, and all coordination is file and event driven.

### GPU Worker Boundaries
- Worker-gpu handles ticket/lease files and telemetry only; GPU hardware access stays on the host-side `gpu-bridge-host`, keeping CUDA/NVML outside the VM and TCB.

## Task Template (use verbatim in planning docs)
```
Title/ID: <slug>
Goal: <one sentence>
Inputs: <artefacts, versions, paths>
Changes:
  - <file> — <summary>
Commands: <exact shell commands (macOS ARM64)>
Checks: <deterministic success criteria>
Deliverables: <files, logs, doc updates>
```

## Roles
- **Planner** — Breaks milestones into atomic tasks using the template above and ensures each new capability or provider field is represented in the compiler IR.
- **Builder** — Implements code/tests, runs commands, documents results.
- **Auditor** — Reviews diffs for scope compliance, verifies generated artefacts match manifest fingerprints, and updates docs.
- **Queen / Workers** — Queen orchestrates control-plane actions; worker-heart emits heartbeat telemetry; worker-gpu mirrors GPU lease/ticket state. No other agent roles exist beyond those sanctioned in `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`.

## Guardrails
- Console Networking Exception — The only permitted in-VM TCP listener is the authenticated root-task console implemented with smoltcp. All other TCP transports (e.g., 9P-over-TCP, GPU control channels) remain host-only. This exception does not relax the prohibition on general-purpose networking services inside the VM.
- Keep rootfs CPIO under 4 MiB (see `ci/size_guard.sh`).
- 9P server runs in userspace; transports abstracted.
- GPU workers run on host/edge nodes; VM only sees mirrored files.
- Document new file types/paths before committing code that depends on them.
- Changes to `/docs/*.md` must reflect the as-built state produced by the compiler (snippets, schemas, `/proc` layouts).

### Docs-as-Built Alignment (MUST apply to Milestone 8 onward)

To prevent drift, you MUST follow these rules:

1. **Docs → IR → Code**
   - Any new behaviour MUST land as IR fields with validation and codegen.
   - Build fails if IR references disabled gates, violates Secure9P bounds, or forces `std` where the runtime is `no_std`.

2. **Autogenerated Snippets**
   - `coh-rtc` refreshes embedded snippets in `SECURE9P.md`, `INTERFACES.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` (CBOR schema, `/proc` tree, concurrency knobs, hardware tables) during release prep.

3. **As-Built Guard**
   - Script compares generated file hashes, manifest fingerprints, and doc excerpts against committed versions. Drift fails CI and blocks release notes.
   - Rule: **Documentation must describe the system “as built”** (post-codegen), not only “as intended”.

4. **Red Lines**
   - Enforced in the compiler and restated here: 9P2000.L, `msize ≤ 8192`, walk depth ≤ 8, no `..`, no fid reuse after clunk, no TCP listeners inside VM unless feature-gated and documented, CPIO < 4 MiB, no POSIX façade, maintain `no_std` for VM artefacts.

5. **Regression Pack (post–Milestone 7c)**
   - From Milestone 8 onward, any change that lands **MUST** re-run the shared regression pack from earlier milestones, not just new tests.
   - The regression pack includes at minimum:
     - `tests/integration/qemu_tcp_console.rs` (Milestone 7 TCP console flow).
     - `tests/cli/boot_v0.cohsh` (baseline help/attach/log/quit script from the manifest compiler).
     - `tests/cli/tracefs_script.sh` (TraceFS JSONL flows).
     - `tests/cli/9p_batch.cohsh` (Secure9P batching).
     - `tests/cli/telemetry_ring.cohsh` (telemetry rings & cursor resumption).
     - `tests/cli/observe_watch.cohsh` (observability `/proc` grammar).
     - `tests/cli/cas_roundtrip.cohsh` (CAS update round-trip).
   - CI for each Milestone ≥ 8 must:
     - Run the full regression pack unchanged and fail on any output drift (including ACK/ERR/END lines, `/proc` grammars, and telemetry formats).
     - Only permit intentional behaviour changes when the relevant CLI scripts, doc snippets, and manifest fields are updated **in the same change**.
   - The regression pack is treated as the canonical “no-regression” harness; new tests are **additive**, not substitutes.

6. **Cross-Milestone Stability Rules**
   - Changes to console ACK/ERR/END grammar, NineDoor error codes, or `/proc` node formats MUST be treated as breaking changes and require:
     - (a) matching updates to all CLI fixtures under `tests/cli/*`,
     - (b) regeneration of manifest-derived snippets,
     - (c) explicit doc updates in `INTERFACES.md`, and
     - (d) a version bump of the manifest schema.
   - Milestones ≥ 9 MUST NOT introduce new 9P verbs or extend grammars unless routed through the manifest compiler and validated by IR red lines.
   - Networking cadence and event-pump tick pacing MUST NOT shift across milestones unless the change is documented in `SECURITY.md` with updated bounds.

### HAL - MUST FOLLOW

- **All device access goes through HAL.**  
  No direct MMIO mapping, no raw physical addresses, no ad-hoc `unsafe` outside the HAL.

- **Drivers depend on HAL; subsystems depend on driver traits.**  
  - Drivers (UART, NIC, future devices) use `KernelHal` / `Hardware` for mapping, DMA, IRQ.  
  - Subsystems (console, NetStack, event pump) depend only on device traits (`UartPort`, `NetDevice`), never concrete chips.

- **No hard-coding of device addresses or layouts anywhere outside HAL.**  
  If a feature “needs a register,” it must be exposed via a HAL descriptor.

- **Device roles, not device models.**  
  HAL selects devices by role (e.g. `PrimaryConsole`, `PrimaryNic`).  
  Higher layers never care whether the device is PL011, RTL8139, virtio, or future hardware.

- **Multiple devices are future-proof by design.**  
  HAL supports multiple UARTs/NICs; higher layers remain unchanged.

- **No control-plane shortcuts around HAL.**  
  CLI, workers, and tests must never bypass HAL for device access.

## Security & Testing Expectations
- Validate all user-controlled input (9P frames, JSON commands).
- No hardcoded secrets; use config or tickets.
- Update or add tests whenever behaviour changes; list executed commands in PR summaries.
- Run `cargo run -p coh-rtc` and verify regenerated artefacts hash-match committed versions before merge.

## Future Notes
- Automated worker lifecycle and `/queen/ctl` bindings for worker-create/worker-kill remain scheduled per `BUILD_PLAN.md` milestones.
- Secure9P surfaces will grow explicit worker-create/worker-kill verbs and GPU lease renewal flows as milestones advance; keep namespace semantics aligned when they land.
