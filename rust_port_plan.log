Plan9 Tool Porting Summary (2025-07-08)
=======================================

Extracted from documentation under workspace/docs/. The following Plan9 helpers were originally implemented in Go:

- `srvctl` registers services under `/srv/services`. Flags `-name` and `-version` recorded metadata. [PLAN9_SERVICE_TOOLS.md lines 10-18]
- `indexserver` builds a filename index and serves query results via `/srv/index`. Flags `--root` and `--interval`. [PLAN9_SERVICE_TOOLS.md lines 20-29]
- `devwatcher` watches paths listed in `/dev/watch/ctl` and appends events to `/dev/watch/events`. [PLAN9_SERVICE_TOOLS.md lines 34-44]
- `physics-server` processes job files from `/mnt/physics_jobs` and writes world and result JSON under `/sim` with status logged to `/srv/physics/status`. [PLAN9_PHYSICS_SERVER.md lines 6-29]

Linux-only helpers remain in Go:

- `coh-9p-helper` proxies 9P traffic between TCP and a Unix socket. [COH_9P_HELPER.md lines 6-22]
- `gui-orchestrator` serves a web dashboard for cluster management. [GUI_ORCHESTRATOR.md lines 7-18]

Design Goal
-----------
Port the Plan9 utilities to Rust while maintaining CLI flags and output paths. Each tool should interact with Plan9 namespaces using standard Rust crates and avoid garbage collection.
