# Threat Model ADR Catalogue

This directory stores Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) generated by the threat model cadence automation. Each file is named `ADR-YYYYMMDD-threat-model-qN.md` and is paired with a calendar event defined in `workspace/docs/security/threat_model_schedule.ics`.

- ADR templates are refreshed by `tools/threat_model_scheduler.py`.
- Trace IDs follow `tmr-YYYYMMDD-qN` and link schedule entries to documentation.
- Update each ADR with review outcomes, mitigations, and sign-offs during the scheduled session.
