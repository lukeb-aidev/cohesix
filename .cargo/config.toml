# APFS and iCloud-attached volumes on macOS 26 occasionally reap the
# temporary directories that rustc creates for incremental compilation.
# When that happens, rustc emits "No such file or directory" errors while
# writing rmeta artefacts (e.g. zerocopy, serde) under `target/debug/deps`,
# matching the failures reported by local builds. Disabling incremental
# globally keeps the build reliable across all crates, including registry
# dependencies that were still opting into incremental compilation even after
# the per-package overrides below.
